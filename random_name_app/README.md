# Flutter Name Generator App

A simple Flutter project I built while learning Flutter.
The app generates random name combinations using the [`english_words`](https://pub.dev/packages/english_words) package and lets you save/remove favorites.

It uses the **Provider** package for state management and demonstrates navigation with a **NavigationRail** layout.

- Generate random name ideas
- Save/remove favorite names
- View all saved favorites in a separate tab
- Responsive layout with `NavigationRail` (switches between compact/extended mode depending on screen width)
